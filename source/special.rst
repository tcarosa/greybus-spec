Special Protocols
=================

This section defines two Protocols, each of which serves a special
purpose in a Greybus system.

The first is the Control Protocol.  Every Interface shall provide a
CPort that uses the Control Protocol.  It's used by the SVC to do
initial probes of Interfaces at system power on.  It is also used by
the AP Module to notify Interfaces when connections are available
for them to use.

The second is the SVC Protocol, which is used only between the SVC
and AP Module.  The SVC provides low-level control of the |unipro|
network.  The SVC performs almost all of its activities under
direction of the AP Module, and the SVC Protocol is used by the AP
Module to exert this control.  The SVC also uses this protocol to
notify the AP Module of events, such as the insertion or removal of
a Module.

.. _control-protocol:

Control Protocol
----------------

All Interfaces are required to define a CPort that uses the Control
Protocol, and shall be prepared to receive Operation requests on that
CPort at any time.  A Greybus connection is established whenever a
control connection is used, but the Interface is never notified that
such a connection exists.  Only the SVC and AP Module are able to send
control requests.  Any other Interface shall only send control
response messages, and such messages shall only be sent in reply to
a request received its control CPort.

Conceptually, the Operations in the Greybus Control Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The sender offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The receiver replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int probe_ap(u16 endo_id, u8 intf_id, u16 *auth_size, u8 *auth_data);

    This Operation is used at initial power-on, sent by the SVC to
    discover which Module contains the AP.  The Endo ID supplied by
    the SVC defines the type of Endo used by the Greybus system,
    including the size of the Endo and the positions and sizes of
    Modules that it holds.  The Interface ID supplied by the SVC
    indicates which Interface Block on the Endo is being probed.
    Together these two values define the location of the Module
    containing the Interface.  Interface ID 0 represents the SVC
    itself; other values are defined in the *Project Ara Module
    Developers Kit*.  The response to this Operation contains a
    block of data used by a Module to identify itself as
    authentically containing an AP.  Non-AP Modules respond with no
    authentication data (*auth_size* is 0).

.. c:function:: int connected(u16 cport_id);

    This Operation is used to notify an Interface that a Greybus
    connection has been established using the indicated CPort.
    Upon receiving this request, an Interface shall be prepared to
    receive messages on the indicated CPort.  The Interface may send
    messages over the indicated CPort once it has sent a response
    to the connected request.  This operation is never used for
    control CPort.

.. c:function:: int disconnected(u16 cport_id);

    This Operation is used to notify an Interface that a previously
    established Greybus connection may no longer be used.  This
    operation is never used for control CPort.

Greybus Control Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All control Operations are contained within a Greybus control
request message. Every control request results in a matching
response.  The request and response messages for each control
Operation are defined below.

Greybus Control Disconnected Response
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Greybus control disconnected response message contains no payload.

.. _svc-protocol:

SVC Protocol
------------

The AP Module is required to provide a CPort that uses the SVC
Protocol on an Interface.  During system initialization the SVC uses
Probe AP Operations to find an Interface on the AP Module.  Once that
Interface is found, the SVC sets up a |unipro| connection from
one of its CPorts to the AP Module Interface's SVC CPort.  It sends
a Control Protocol connected operation to the Interface, notifying
it that the SVC CPort is connected and ready to use.

The SVC has direct control over and responsibility for the Endo,
including detecting when modules are present, configuring the
|unipro| switch, powering module Interfaces, and attaching and
detaching modules.  The AP Module controls the Endo through
operations sent over the SVC connection.  And the SVC informs the AP
Module about Endo events (such as the presence of a new module, or
notification of changing power conditions).

Conceptually, the operations in the Greybus SVC Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int intf_device_id(u8 intf_id, u8 device_id);

    This operation is used by the AP Module to request that the SVC
    associate a device ID with the given Interface.

.. c:function:: int intf_hotplug(u8 intf_id, u16 size, u8 *data);

.. XXX We may need to adjust based on whether detect is associated
.. XXX with a module (as opposed to an Interface).

    The SVC sends this to the AP Module to inform it that it has
    detected a module on the indicated Interface.  It supplies a
    block of data that describes the module that been attached.

.. c:function:: int intf_hotunplug(u8 intf_id);

    The SVC sends this to the AP Module to tell it that a module is
    no longer present on an Interface.

.. c:function:: int intf_reset(u8 intf_id);

    The SVC sends this to inform the AP Module that an active
    Interface needs to be reset.  This might happen when the SVC has
    detected
    an error on the link, for example.

.. XXX This is nebulous at this point; my intention is to handle the
.. XXX case where a UniPro "link down" indicates that a link *was*
.. XXX down at some point--since we have no way to discover this
.. XXX immediately.

.. c:function:: int connection_create(u8 intf1_id, u16 cport1_id, u8 intf2_id, u16 cport2_id);

    The AP Module uses this operation to request the SVC set up a
    |unipro| connection between CPorts on two Interfaces.

.. c:function:: int connection_destroy(u8 intf1_id, u16 cport1_id, u8 intf2_id, u16 cport2_id);

    The AP Module uses this operation to request the SVC tear down a
    previously created connection.

Greybus SVC Operations

All SVC Operations are contained within a Greybus SVC request
message. Every SVC request results in a matching response.  The
request and response messages for each SVC Operation are defined

Greybus SVC Interface Device ID Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus SVC Interface Device ID Operation is used by the AP
Module to request the SVC associate a device id with an Interface.
The device id is used by the |unipro| switch to determine how
packets should be routed through the network.  The AP Module is
responsible for managing the mapping between Interfaces and UniPro
device ids.  Note that the SVC always uses device ID 0, and the AP
Module always uses device ID 1.

Greybus SVC Interface Device ID Request
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Greybus SVC Interface device ID request is sent only by the AP
Module to the SVC.  It supplies the device ID that the SVC should
associate with the indicated Interface.  The AP Module can remove
the association of an Interface with a device ID by assigning device
ID value 0.  It is an error to assign a (non-zero) device ID to an
Interface that already has one, or to clear the device ID of an
Interface that has no device ID assigned.

Note that assigning a device ID to an Interface does not cause
the SVC to set up any routes for that device ID.  Routes are
set up only as needed when a connection involving a device ID
are created, and removed when an Interface's last connection is
destroyed.

it sends an Interface Hotplug Request to the AP Module.  The hotplug
request is sent after the Interface's |unipro| link has been
established.  The size and data values describe a structured block
of additional information known by the SVC about the discovered
Interface (such as the vendor and product ID).  The format of
this data is TBD.
