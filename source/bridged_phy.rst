Bridged PHY Connection Protocols
================================

This section defines a group of Protocols whose purpose is to support
communication with Modules on the Greybus network which do not comply
with an existing device class Protocol, and which include integrated
circuits using alternative physical interfaces to |unipro|. Modules
which implement any of the Protocols defined in this section are said
to be *non-device class conformant*.

USB Protocol
------------

We support bulk, control, and interrupt transfers, but not
isochronous at this point in time.

Details TBD.

GPIO Protocol
-------------

A connection using the GPIO Protocol on a |unipro| network is used to
manage a simple GPIO controller. Such a GPIO controller implements
from one to 256 GPIO lines. Each of the operations defined below
specifies the line to which the operation applies.

Conceptually, the GPIO Protocol operations are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The sender offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The receiver replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int line_count(u8 *count);

    Returns one less than the number of lines managed by the Greybus
    GPIO controller. This means the minimum number of lines is 1 and
    the maximum is 256.

.. c:function:: int activate(u8 which);

    Notifies the GPIO controller that one of its lines has been
    assigned for use.

.. c:function:: int deactivate(u8 which);

    Notifies the GPIO controller that a previously activated line has
    been unassigned and can be deactivated.

.. c:function:: int get_direction(u8 which, u8 *direction);

    Requests the GPIO controller return a line's configured direction
    (0 for output, 1 for input).

.. c:function:: int direction_input(u8 which);

    Requests the GPIO controller configure a line for input.

.. c:function:: int direction_output(u8 which, u8 value);

    Requests the GPIO controller configure a line for output, and sets
    its initial output value (0 for low, 1 for high).

.. c:function:: int get_value(u8 which, u8 *value);

    Requests the GPIO controller return the current value sensed on a
    line (0 for low, 1 for high).

.. c:function:: int set_value(u8 which, u8 value);

    Requests the GPIO controller set the value (0 for low, 1 for high)
    for a line configured for output.

.. c:function:: int set_debounce(u8 which, u16 usec);

    Requests the GPIO controller set the debounce period (in
    microseconds).

.. c:function:: int irq_type(u8 which, u8 type);

    Requests the GPIO controller set the IRQ trigger type (none,
    falling/rising edge, or low/high level).

.. c:function:: int irq_mask(u8 which);

    Requests the GPIO controller mask the specified gpio irq line.

.. c:function:: int irq_unmask(u8 which);

    Requests the GPIO controller unmask the specified gpio irq line.

.. c:function:: void irq_event(u8 which);

    GPIO controller request to recipient signaling an event on the specified
    gpio irq line.

Greybus GPIO Protocol Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All operations sent to a GPIO controller are contained within a
Greybus GPIO request message. Every operation request results in a
matching response from the GPIO controller, also taking the form of a
GPIO controller message.  The request and response messages for each
GPIO operation are defined below.

Table :num:`table-gpio-operation-type` defines the Greybus GPIO
Protocol operation types and their values. Both the request type and
response type values are shown.

SPI Protocol
------------

This section defines the operations used on a connection implementing
the Greybus SPI Protocol. This Protocol allows for management of a SPI
device. The Protocol consists of the operations defined in this
section.

Conceptually, the operations in the Greybus SPI Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The sender offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The receiver replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int get_mode(u16 *mode);

    Returns a bit mask indicating the modes supported by the SPI master.

.. c:function:: int get_flags(u16 *flags);

    Returns a bit mask indicating the constraints of the SPI master.

.. c:function:: int get_bits_per_word(u32 *bpw);

    Returns the number of bits per word supported by the SPI master.

.. c:function:: int get_chipselect_num(u16 *num);

    Returns the number of chip select pins supported by the SPI master.

.. c:function:: int transfer(u8 chip_select, u8 mode, u8 count, struct gb_spi_transfer *transfers);

    Performs a SPI transaction as one or more SPI transfers, defined in the
    supplied array.

A transfer is made up of an array of :ref:`gb_spi_transfer <gb_spi_transfer>`
descriptors, each of which specifies SPI master configurations during transfers.
For write requests, the data is sent following the array of messages; for read
requests, the data is returned in a response message from the SPI master.

Greybus SPI Message Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Table :num:`table-spi-operation-type` defines the Greybus SPI
operation types and their values. A message type consists of an
operation type combined with a flag (0x80) indicating whether the
operation is a request or a response.

UART Protocol
-------------

A connection using the UART Protocol on a |unipro| network is used to
manage a simple UART controller.  This Protocol is very close to the
CDC protocol for serial modems from the USB-IF specification, and
consists of the operations defined in this section.

The operations that can be performed on a Greybus UART controller are
conceptually:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The sender offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The receiver replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int send_data(u16 size, u8 *data);

    Requests that the UART device begin transmitting characters. One
    or more bytes to be transmitted shall be supplied by the sender.

.. c:function:: int receive_data(u16 *size, u8 *data);

    Receive data from the UART.  The indicated number of bytes has
    been received.

.. c:function:: int set_line_coding(u32 rate, u8 format, u8 parity, u8 data);

   Sets the line settings of the UART to the specified baud rate,
   format, parity, and data bits.

.. c:function:: int set_control_line_state(u8 state);

    Controls RTS and DTR line states of the UART.

.. c:function:: int send_break(u8 state);

    Requests that the UART generate a break condition on its transmit
    line.

.. c:function:: int serial_state(u16 *state);

    Receives the state of the UART's control lines and any line errors
    that might have occurred.

PWM Protocol
------------

A connection using PWM Protocol on a |unipro| network is used to manage
a simple PWM controller. Such a PWM controller implements one or more
(up to 256) PWM devices, and each of the operations below specifies
the line to which the operation applies. This Protocol consists of the
operations defined in this section.

Conceptually, the PWM Protocol operations are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The sender offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The receiver replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int pwm_count(u8 *count);

    Returns one less than the number of instances managed by the
    Greybus PWM controller. This means the minimum number of PWMs is 1
    and the maximum is 256.

.. c:function:: int activate(u8 which);

    Notifies the PWM controller that one of its instances has been
    assigned for use.

.. c:function:: int deactivate(u8 which);

    Notifies the PWM controller that a previously activated instance
    has been unassigned and can be deactivated.

.. c:function:: int config(u8 which, u32 duty, u32 period);

    Requests the PWM controller configure an instance for a particular
    duty cycle and period (in units of nanoseconds).

.. c:function:: int set_polarity(u8 which, u8 polarity);

    Requests the PWM controller configure an instance as normally
    active or inverted.

.. c:function:: int enable(u8 which);

    Requests the PWM controller enable a PWM instance to begin
    toggling.

.. c:function:: int disable(u8 which);

    Requests the PWM controller disable a previously enabled PWM
    instance

Greybus PWM Protocol Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All operations sent to a PWM controller are contained within a Greybus
PWM request message. Every operation request results in a response
from the PWM controller, also taking the form of a PWM controller
message.  The request and response messages for each PWM operation are
defined below.

Table :num:`table-pwm-operation-type` describes the Greybus PWM Protocol
operation types and their values. Both the request type and response type values
are shown.

I2S Protocols
-------------

..  'I2S' should be replaced by 'Audio Streaming' or similar
    because more than i2s is supported by what's defined here.

Audio data may be streamed using the I2S Protocols Specification
described herein.  The I2S Protocols Specification is designed to
support arbitrarily complex audio topologies with any number of
intermediate Modules.  A Module that supports the I2S Protocols
Specification shall be referred to as an *I2S Module* even when
the Module supports other Greybus Protocols.

.. note::

    Where possible, the I2S Protocols Specification tries to be consistent
    with the
    `USB Audio Specification Version 2.0
    <http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/Audio2.0_final.zip>`_.
    The I2S Protocols Specification is designed to handle
    *Type I Simple Audio Data Format*
    data as defined in Section 2.3.1 of the
    *USB Device Class Definition for Audio Data Formats*
    document.  This does not preclude the use of other
    data formats.

An I2S Module shall contain one or more *I2S Bundles*.  Each I2S Bundle
shall contain one *I2S Management CPort*, and may contain zero or
more *I2S Transmitter CPorts* and zero or more *I2S Receiver CPorts*.
There shall be at least one I2S Transmitter or Receiver CPort in each
I2S Bundle.  An I2S Bundle may have no physical low-level I2S or
similar hardware associated with it.

I2S Management CPorts, I2S Transmitter CPorts, and I2S Receiver CPorts
have unique CPort Protocol values in the `protocol` field of the CPort
Descriptor in an interface Manifest.

An *I2S Transmitter Bundle* is an I2S Bundle containing at least one
I2S Transmitter CPort.  Similarly for an *I2S Receiver Bundle*.
The terms *Transmitter* and *Receiver* are from the perspective of the
|unipro| network.  So an I2S Transmitter Bundle is an I2S Bundle capable
of sending audio data into the |unipro| network, while an I2S
Receiver Bundle is capable of receiving a data from a local
low-level I2S interface.  An I2S Bundle may be both an I2S
Transmitter Bundle and an I2S Receiver Bundle.

As a special case, I2S Management CPorts in an AP Module that are used
to manage I2S Bundles may exist apart from an I2S Bundle.  This shall
not prevent the AP Module from having I2S Bundles.  For example, the
AP Module may have an I2S Bundle for sending ringtones to the Speaker
Module when an incoming voice call arrives.  In this case, the I2S
Management CPort in the AP Module's I2S Bundle is distinct from the
I2S Management CPort used by the AP Module to manage that I2S Bundle.
The AP Module shall treat any I2S Bundle it exposes to the |unipro|
network no differently than an I2S Bundle in any other I2S Module.

Separate Management and Data Protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two separate Protocols contained within the I2S Protocols
Specification.  The first Protocol is the
:ref:`i2s-management-protocol`, which is used to manage audio streams.
The second Protocol is the :ref:`i2s-data-protocol` and is used by I2S
Modules to stream audio data to one another.  Because the send and
receive side of the data Protocol play different roles, each has
a distinct Protocol identifier.

The I2S Management Protocol is used over an *I2S Management Connection*
which connects two I2S Management CPorts.  At least one of the I2S
Management CPorts shall be in the AP Module.  The I2S Data Protocol
is used over an *I2S Data Connection* which connects an I2S Transmitter
CPort to an I2S Receiver CPort.

.. _i2s-audio-data-attributes:

Audio Data Attributes and Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For audio data to be streamed and delivered correctly, the I2S Bundles
at both ends of an I2S Data Connection shall be configured similarly.
Note that it is possible for I2S Data Connections in an overall audio
stream to have their associated I2S Bundles configured differently.
For example, an intermediate I2S Module that is a sampling rate
converter may have different sampling rates for its receiving and
transmitting I2S Data Connections.  Even so, the I2S Bundles at
either end of each I2S Data Connection shall be configured similarly.

It is the responsibility of the AP Module to ensure that both the
individual I2S Data Connections, and the overall set of I2S Data
Connections combined with the functions of internal I2S Modules
and non-\ |unipro| devices are configured correctly.

The I2S Protocols Specification defines the *transfer* of audio data,
not the production or consumption of audio data.
Therefore, the encoding method, compression technique, and audio data
representation are irrelevant with respect to the I2S Protocols
Specification.  However, there are attributes of the audio data
that are relevant and are described herein.

The *Configuration* of an I2S Bundle or Data Connection is the set
of values used by the I2S Bundle or Data Connection for these audio
data attributes.  The I2S Protocols Specification places constraints
on the Configuration.  These constraints are:

*   the Configuration (i.e., sample frequency, number of channels
    per sample, etc.) of an I2S Bundle may not change while there is
    an active I2S Transmitter or Receiver CPort in the I2S Bundle;
*   the number of audio data bits for a sample on an individual channel
    shall be an integer multiple of eight;
*   the number of audio data bits for each channel shall be equal;
*   as per the USB Audio Specification, the number of bytes of audio
    data shall be one, two, three, or four;
*   every :ref:`i2s-send-data-op` shall send an integer number of
    audio data samples.

Some audio data attributes commonly differ for reasons including
underlying hardware constraints and the audio application.
These attributes shall be configurable.  The configurable audio
data attributes are:

*   the sample frequency which is the number of audio sample taken
    per second;
*   the number of audio channels per sample;
*   the number of bytes in a sample of audio channel data;
*   the byte order of multi-byte audio channel data;
*   the spatial location of the audio channels.

The spatial location of the audio channels is defined by the
USB Audio Specification.  The number of channels per sample
in the Configuration shall equal the number of spatial locations
selected by the Configuration.

There are other configurable attributes that don't affect the audio
data within the |unipro| audio stream but do affect the low-level
interface between the I2S Bundle and a non-\ |unipro| audio device.
These are :ref:`i2s-low-level-attributes`.

It is necessary to include these attributes in the I2S Configuration
data because the AP Module requires this information in order to
configure the low-level interface of the non-\ |unipro| device.
Examples of non-\ |unipro| audio devices are analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), combined
ADC/DACs called coders-decoders (codecs), and audio mixers.

In order to configure the I2S Bundles at each end of an I2S Data
Connection similarly, the AP Module requires the ability to query
the I2S Bundles to see which options for each attribute the
I2S Bundle supports.  To enable this, the I2S Management Protocol contains
the :ref:`i2s-get-supported-configurations-op` which returns an array
of structures that describe the configurations supported by the I2S
Bundle.  Each entry of the array is a :ref:`i2s-configuration-struct`.
The AP Module also requires the ability to set the attribute values
of the I2S Bundle.  The :ref:`i2s-set-configuration-op` is provided for
this purpose.

Some attributes in the :ref:`i2s-configuration-struct` returned by
the :ref:`i2s-get-supported-configurations-op` may have multiple options
set.  This indicates that more than one option for that attribute is
supported by the I2S Bundle; however, only one option shall be selected
in the :ref:`i2s-configuration-struct` passed in the
:ref:`i2s-set-configuration-op`.

Configuration of the I2S Bundle shall be performed while no CPorts
in the I2S Bundle are active.

.. _i2s-low-level-attributes:

I2S Low-level Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several I2S Low-level Attributes supported by the
I2S Protocols Specification.  Some of the I2S Low-level Attributes
vary depending on the *low-level Interface Protocol* so more
I2S Low-level Attributes may be added as support for additional
Low-level Interface Protocols is added.  The current I2S Low-level
Attributes are:

*   the Low-level Interface Protocol;
*   the I2S Bundle's role (master or slave) with respect to the Bit Clock (BCLK);
*   the I2S Bundle's role with respect to the Word Clock (WCLK);
*   the polarity of the WCLK;
*   the BCLK edge that the WCLK changes on;
*   the BCLK edge when transmit bits are presented;
*   the BCLK edge when receive bits are latched;
*   the number of BCLK cycles between when WCLK changes and when
    data for the next channel is presented.

The Low-level Interface Protocol specifies the Protocol used by the
3- (or more) wire interface between the I2S Bundle and the non-\ |unipro|
device.  The currently supported Low-level Interface Protocols are:
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), Inter-IC Sound (I2S), and Left-Right Stereo
(LR Stereo).  They are described in more detail below.

Sometimes Low-level Interface Protocols also specify the format of the
audio data (e.g., I2S).  For this discussion, the audio data format is
irrelevant and only the Low-level Interface Protocol is relevant.

The I2S Bundle's *role* with respect to the Bit and Word Clocks specifies
whether the I2S Bundle generates the respective clock signal or not.
When the I2S Bundle generates the clock signal, its role is *clock master*;
when it does not generate the clock signal, its role is *clock slave*.

The polarity of the WCLK may be reversed for some Low-level Interface
Protocols.  The effects of reversing the WCLK polarity varies by
Low-level Interface Protocol.  The WCLK is also referred to as the
Left-Right Clock (LRCLK) and Word Select (WS).

The remaining I2S Low-level Attributes specify which BCLK edge
various events are synchronized to.

Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Low-level Interface Protocol
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There are many variations of the `Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation>`_
Low-level Interface Protocol.  Most variations are supported
by setting I2S Low-level Attributes appropriately.

..  The link above is useless.  The only other links I've found
    that have decent descriptions are in datasheets for parts
    and the description is buried in the middle.
    Best example I have is:
    http://kcwirefree.com/docs/guides/kcTechnicalAudio.pdf.
    Jump to Sections 10.3.2 and 10.3.3 (p. 12).  Other parts
    have variation of this.  There doesn't seem to be one
    standard.

The PCM Low-level Interface Protocol uses the WCLK signal for
transmitting *Frame SYNC* pulses.  A Frame SYNC pulse is transmitted
when the WCLK master reverses the WCLK polarity for one or more BCLK cycles.
The beginning of a Frame SYNC pulse signals the beginning of a new sample.
The audio data for all channels in the sample is transferred between
Frame SYNC pulses.  If there is no more audio data to transfer,
zero bits are transferred until the next Frame SYNC pulse (which
signals the start of the next sample).

Important points are:

*   one or more audio channels may be transferred;
*   the BCLK role may be master or slave;
*   the WCLK role may be master or slave;
*   the WCLK polarity may be normal or reversed (normal is when
    the WCLK is low except when a Frame SYNC pulse is being transmitted);
*   the WCLK may change on the rising or falling edge of the BCLK;
*   data bits being transmitted may be presented on the rising or
    falling edge of BCLK;
*   data bits being received may be latched on the rising or falling
    edge of BCLK;
*   the first bit of the new sample may start on the same BCLK
    edge as the WCLK signal (i.e., no offset) or one BCLK cycle
    later (i.e., offset by one).

Inter-IC Sound (I2S) Low-level Interface Protocol
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The `Inter-IC Sound (I2S)
<https://web.archive.org/web/20060702004954/http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/acrobat_download/various/I2SBUS.pdf>`_
Low-level Interface Protocol specifies some I2S Low-level Attribute
values but leaves others open.  The WCLK signal specifies
whether the left or right channel's audio data is being
transferred.

Important points are:

*   there are two channels per sample;
*   the BCLK role may be master or slave;
*   the WCLK role may be master or slave;
*   the WCLK polarity may be normal or reversed (normal is when
    the left channel data is transferred when WCLK is low and the
    right channel data is transferred when WCLK is high);
*   the WCLK may change on the rising or falling edge of the BCLK;
*   data bits being transmitted may be presented on the rising or
    falling edge of BCLK;
*   data bits being received are latched on the rising edge of BCLK;
*   the first bit of the new sample starts one BCLK cycle after WCLK
    changes (i.e., offset by one).

LR Stereo Low-level Interface Protocol
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The *LR Stereo* Low-level Interface Protocol refers to the
Protocol used by
`Left-justified and Right-justified Stereo Formats
<http://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/appNote/AN282REV1.pdf>`_.
The only difference between the two formats is whether
the audio data is left- or right-justified.  The justification
of the audio data is not relevant to the Low-level Interface Protocol
so the Protocols for the two formats are combined into the
LR Stereo Low-level Interface Protocol.

..  I don't like having a hardware vendor's link here but
    I can't find a better one.

The LR Stereo Low-level Interface Protocol is similar to I2S except
the WCLK polarity is reversed and there is no offset between
when WCLK changes and when data for the next channel is presented.

Important points are:

*   there are two channels per sample;
*   the BCLK role may be master or slave;
*   the WCLK role may be master or slave;
*   the WCLK polarity may be normal or reversed (normal is when
    the left channel data is transferred when WCLK is high and the
    right channel data is transferred when WCLK is low);
*   the WCLK may change on the rising or falling edge of the BCLK;
*   data bits being transmitted may be presented on the rising or
    falling edge of BCLK;
*   data bits being received may be latched on the rising or falling
    edge of BCLK;
*   the first bit of the new sample starts on the same BCLK
    edge as the WCLK signal (i.e., no offset).

.. _i2s-audio-samples-per-message:

Audio Samples per Greybus Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since audio samples tend to small but sent many times per second,
and small delays are not perceptible by the human ear, the I2S Protocols
Specification supports combining multiple audio samples into one Greybus
Message.  This is configured using the :ref:`i2s-set-samples-per-message-op`.
The I2S Transmitter and Receiver Bundles at each end of an
I2S Data Connection shall be set to the same samples per message value.
Once set, the I2S Transmitter Bundle shall send the specified number
of audio samples in each :ref:`i2s-send-data-op`.

Setting the samples per message is considered part of the audio stream
configuration and shall be performed while no CPorts are active
in the I2S Bundle.  Once set, the samples per message value shall
remain in effect indefinitely or until modified by another
:ref:`i2s-set-samples-per-message-op`.

When the samples per message is not set, a default value of one shall
be used.

.. _i2s-audio-video-synchronization:

Audio and Video Synchronization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the I2S Management Protocol's goals is to support synchronizing
audio output with video output.  To that end, the
:ref:`i2s-get-processing-delay-op` provides the AP Module with the amount
of time the I2S Bundle takes to *process* the audio data.  The *processing*
required depends on the I2S Bundle.  For example, an audio mixer's
processing may involve mixing the data from two separate audio streams
while a Speaker Module's processing may involve streaming audio data to
a DAC.  The delay value returned by the Operation should be accurate
to within 500 microseconds.

..  I expect this value to be zero in most cases.  Hopefully, there
    is something similar for video streams so the AP Module can
    determine if it needs to delay the audio stream so the video
    stream can "fill its pipeline".

The I2S Management Protocol contains the :ref:`i2s-set-start-delay-op`
which causes the I2S Transmitter Bundle to buffer its audio data for the
specified amount of time before streaming it.  This only delays when
audio streaming *starts*.  The delay time begins when the first
I2S Transmitter CPort in the I2S Transmitter Bundle is activated.
When the delay time elapses, the I2S Transmitter Bundle shall
begin streaming audio data to its active I2S Transmitter CPorts.
If no I2S Transmitter CPorts are active when the delay time elapses,
no audio data is streamed and any buffered audio data shall be discarded.
The I2S Transmitter Bundle shall delay with an accuracy of 500 microseconds.

It is possible for an I2S Transmitter Bundle to send the buffered data
faster than the audio samples can be output at the final destination.
When this happens, it effectively transfers the audio data buffering
downstream but does not change the audio output at the final destination.

..  Should E2EFC be enabled so audio data isn't discarded when a
    downstream Bundle doesn't have enough space to hold it all?

Setting the start delay is considered part of the audio stream configuration
and shall be performed while no CPorts are active in the I2S Bundle.
Once set, the start delay shall remain in effect indefinitely or until
modified by another :ref:`i2s-set-start-delay-op`.
When the start delay is not set, a default value of zero shall be used.

.. _i2s-audio-stream-activation-deactivation:

Audio Stream Activation and Deactivation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the I2S Bundles in a planned audio stream are configured
(i.e., configuration set, samples per message set,
start delay set), audio streaming is ready to begin.
The AP Module starts audio streaming by activating the
I2S Data Connections making up the planned audio stream.
To activate an I2S Data Connection, the AP Module uses
:ref:`i2s-activate-cport-op` to activate the I2S Transmitter
and Receiver CPorts at each end of the I2S Data Connection.

When the first I2S Transmitter CPort in an I2S Bundle is
activated, the start delay time begins and the I2S Bundle
starts buffering audio data.  When the start delay time
elapses, the I2S Bundle begins streaming the audio data
to all active I2S Transmitter CPorts in the I2S Bundle.

I2S Transmitters CPorts may be added or removed while the
I2S Bundle is actively streaming.  When an I2S Transmitter
CPort is activated, its active downstream I2S Data Connections
shall begin receiving audio data and become part of the overall
audio stream.  When an I2S Transmitter CPort is deactivated, its
active downstream I2S Data Connections shall stop receiving audio
data and shall no longer be part of the overall audio stream.
When the last I2S Transmitter CPort in an I2S Bundle is deactivated,
the I2S Bundle may free the resources allocated for the stream
and discard any buffered audio data.

When an I2S Receiver CPort in an I2S Bundle is activated,
it shall wait for audio data to arrive.  When audio data
arrives, it shall pass the data onto the device or function
on whose behalf it is receiving data.

I2S Receiver Bundles may be overrun by incoming audio data.
When an overrun occurs, the I2S Receiver Bundle shall discard
the incoming data.  The I2S Receiver Bundle may buffer
audio data so audio data is not discarded as often.  Whether
audio data is buffered and how much audio data to buffer
is left to the I2S Receiver Bundle designer.  When the I2S
Receiver Bundle is overrun while buffering audio data, it
may discard buffered audio data, the incoming audio data,
or a combination of both.  Regardless of how overruns are
handled, audio data shall remain in order.

.. _i2s-streaming-audio-data:

Streaming Audio Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An I2S Transmitter Bundle streams audio data to an
I2S Receiver Bundle over an I2S Data Connection using
:ref:`i2s-send-data-op`\s.  Each I2S Send Data Request
contains at least one complete audio sample.
A complete audio sample contains one sample of
audio data for every audio channel being streamed.

Every audio sample sent over an I2S Data Connection
is numbered beginning at zero.  Since different I2S Transmitter
CPorts within the I2S Transmitter Bundle may be
activated at different times, the same audio sample
may be numbered differently in each I2S Data Connection.
However, within an I2S Data Connection the audio sample
number shall begin at zero and increment by one for each
audio sample.

To enable an I2S Receiver Bundle to recognize that one
or more I2S Send Data Requests are missing, each
I2S Send Data Request contains a `sample_number` field.
The `sample_number` field contains the sample number of
the first audio sample contained in the I2S Send Data Request.
The I2S Transmitter Bundle shall increase the value placed
in the `sample_number` field of consecutive I2S Send Data
Requests by the number of audio samples contained in each request.
See :ref:`i2s-send-data-op` for further details on the
I2S Send Data Requests.

When an I2S Receiver Bundle receives an I2S Send Data
Request whose `sample_number` field value does not match
the expected sample number, it can determine the action
to take by comparing the sample number it expected to
the sample number it received.

If the sample number the I2S Receiver Bundle expected is
less than the sample number in the received request,
then at least one I2S Send Data Request is missing.
In this situation, the I2S Receiver Bundle shall fabricate
audio data and substitute the fabricated data for the missing
data.  The number of audio samples to fabricate is calculated
by subtracting the audio sample number in the received
request by the one expected.
How the missing audio data is fabricated is left to
the I2S Module designer.

For example, if the samples per message has been set to four
and the I2S Receiver Bundle has received I2S Send Data Requests
whose `sample_number` values are zero, four, and twelve,
then the I2S Receiver Bundle shall fabricate audio data
for audio samples eight, nine, ten, and eleven.

If the sample number the I2S Receiver Bundle expected is
greater than or equal to the sample number in the received
request, then either the I2S Send Request is a duplicate or
the I2S Send Request arrived late and the I2S Receiver
Bundle has fabricated audio data in its place.  In either
case, the I2S Receiver Bundle shall discard the contents
of the I2S Send Data Request.

It is possible for the I2S Receiver Bundle to be overrun
with incoming I2S Send Data Requests or to underrun by
not having audio data available when required.
The handling of these conditions is left to the I2S Module
designer.

.. _i2s-errors-and-event-reporting:

Errors and Event Reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Audio data streaming events detected by the I2S Bundle
are reported to the AP Module using :ref:`i2s-report-event-op`\s.
Events include Greybus I2S Protocol errors, audio data underrun,
and audio data overrun.  The I2S Bundle shall report events when
one or more I2S Transmitter or Receiver CPorts are active;
otherwise, it shall not report events.

The *halted* event indicates that the I2S Bundle is unable to continue
streaming.  This event shall be preceded by another event indicating
why the I2S Bundle halted.  Once an I2S Bundle reports the halted
event, the AP Module shall deactivate all active I2S Transmitter and
Receiver CPorts.

In order to prevent flooding the AP Module with events,
an I2S Bundle shall only report an event once per occurrence
and shall report no event within 10 milliseconds of a previous
event (except for the halted event which may follow immediately
after another event).

..  This needs more thought.

Example Audio Scenario (Informative)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Audio configurations may be complex and require several I2S
Data Connections to perform the desired task.
Figure 10.1 illustrates one example.  In the figure, the AP Module
generates a ringtone indicating that their is an incoming call.
The local party answers the call and begins recording.
When necessary, the AP Module generates alert tones indicating to
the local party that an event has occurred (e.g., an SMS text message
arrived).  Several I2S Modules and I2S Audio Connections are
required to carry out these tasks.

    Example Audio Scenario (I2S Data Connections shown)

To set up an audio stream between two I2S Bundles, the AP Module
performs the following steps using the :ref:`control-protocol` and
the :ref:`i2s-management-protocol`.

*   Create a |unipro| Connection between the AP Module
    and each I2S Bundle.  These Connections are the
    I2S Management Connections.
*   Create a |unipro| Connection between the I2S Transmitter CPort
    in the I2S Transmitter Bundle and the I2S Receiver CPort in the
    I2S Receiver Bundle.  This Connection is the I2S Data Connection.
*   Query the I2S Bundles and retrieve the supported configurations
    for each.
*   Determine a configuration suitable to both I2S Bundles
    and any intermediate functions or non-\ |unipro| devices
    involved in the streaming.
*   Set the I2S Bundles, intermediate functions, and non-\ |unipro| devices
    to the chosen configuration.
*   If desired, set the number of audio samples per Greybus Message
    in the I2S Transmitter Bundle.  Otherwise one sample per Greybus
    Message shall be sent.
*   If required, determine the start up delay required to synchronize the
    audio data with the video data.
*   If required, set the start delay for the I2S Transmitter Bundle.
    Otherwise a start delay of zero shall be used.
*   If present, configure and start the intermediate functions and
    non-\ |unipro| devices.
*   Activate the I2S Receiver CPort in the I2S Receiver Bundle.
*   Activate the I2S Transmitter CPort in the I2S Transmitter Bundle.

The I2S Transmitter Bundle may now stream audio data to the
I2S Receiver Bundle using :ref:`i2s-send-data-op`\s.

To tear down an audio stream between two I2S Bundles, the AP Module
performs the following steps using the :ref:`control-protocol` and
the :ref:`i2s-management-protocol`:

*   Deactivate the I2S Transmitter CPort in the I2S Transmitter Bundle.
    This stops the I2S Transmitter Bundle from streaming audio data
    over the associated I2S Data Connection.
*   Deactivate the I2S Receiver CPort in the I2S Receiver Bundle.
*   Destroy the |unipro| Connection between the two I2S Bundles
    used for the I2S Data Connection.
*   Destroy the two |unipro| Connections between the AP Module
    and I2S Bundles used for the I2S Management Connections.

When multiple I2S Data Connections are used in an audio stream,
the AP Module shall ensure that the selected configuration satisfies
the constraints of all the I2S Bundles, intermediate Modules,
and non-\ |unipro| devices involved.

.. _i2s-management-protocol:

I2S Management Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I2S Management Protocol Operations are communicated over I2S Management
Connections.  I2S Management Connections connect the AP Module to
I2S Bundles.  There shall be an I2S Management Connection between
the AP Module and each I2S Bundle participating in the audio stream.

In the following descriptions, Operations apply to the I2S Bundle
associated with the I2S Management Connection that the Operation is
sent on.  Similarly, arguments to parameters such as `cport` shall
be CPorts contained within the I2S Bundle associated with the
I2S Management Connection that the Operation is sent on.

Conceptually, the I2S Management Protocol Operations are:

.. c:function:: int get_supported_configurations(u8 *configurations, struct gb_i2s_configuration *configurations);

    Requests the I2S Bundle return an array of :ref:`i2s-configuration-struct`
    describing the configurations it supports.

.. c:function:: int set_configuration(struct gb_i2s_configuration *configuration);

    Requests the I2S Bundle set its configuration values to
    those specified by the supplied configuration.

.. c:function:: int set_samples_per_message(u16 samples_per_message);

    Requests the I2S Bundle send the specified number of audio
    samples in each :ref:`i2s-send-data-op`.

    The default samples per message value shall be 0.

.. c:function:: int get_processing_delay(u32 *microseconds);

    Returns the number of microseconds the I2S Bundle requires
    to process an audio sample before it is forwarded.

..  The USB Audio spec expresses this delay in audio microframes
    instead of microseconds (Section 3.12 of USB Dev Class Def.
    for Audio Devices v2.0).  The issue I have with this is the
    number of microframes varies depending on the sampling rate
    (if I understand what they're doing correctly).  It seems
    simpler to just use microseconds but maybe it should change
    to match USB.

.. c:function:: int set_start_delay(u32 microseconds);

    Requests the I2S Transmitter Bundle buffer audio data
    for the specified amount of time before beginning to
    stream it.

    The default start delay value shall be 0.

.. c:function:: int activate_cport(u16 cport);

    Requests the I2S Bundle activate the specified CPort.

    When `cport` refers to an I2S Transmitter CPort,
    the I2S Bundle shall send audio data through that CPort.
    When `cport` refers to an I2S Receiver CPort,
    the I2S Bundle shall forward the audio data from the CPort
    to the device or function on whose behalf it is receiving
    the audio data.

.. c:function:: int deactivate_cport(u16 cport);

    Requests the I2S Bundle deactivate the specified CPort.
    When this operation completes, the I2S Bundle shall no
    longer send or receive audio data on the specified CPort.

..  I keep debating whether to have start & stop ops but they
    wouldn't be any different than the activate/deactivate ops
    already defined.  Adding them would just create more work
    for AP.

.. c:function:: int report_event(u32 event);

    Reports an I2S Audio Event. The events are described in
    :ref:`i2s-audio-events`.

I2C Protocol
------------

This section defines the operations used on a connection implementing
the Greybus I2C Protocol. This Protocol allows for management of an I2C
device present on a Module. The Protocol consists of five basic
operations, whose request and response message formats are defined
here.

Conceptually, the five operations in the Greybus I2C Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The sender offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The receiver replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int get_functionality(u32 *functionality);

    Returns a bitmask indicating the features supported by the I2C
    adapter.

.. c:function:: int set_timeout(u16 timeout_ms);

   Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) the I2C adapter should allow
   before giving up on an addressed client.

.. c:function:: int set_retries(u8 retries);

   Sets the number of times an adapter should retry an I2C op before
   giving up.

.. c:function:: int transfer(u8 op_count, struct i2c_op *ops);

   Performs an I2C transaction made up of one or more "steps" defined
   in the supplied I2C op array.

A transfer is made up of an array of "I2C ops", each of which
specifies an I2C slave address, flags controlling message behavior,
and a length of data to be transferred. For write requests, the data
is sent following the array of messages; for read requests, the data
is returned in a response message from the I2C adapter.

Table :num:`table-i2c-operation-type` defines the Greybus I2C

Greybus I2C Set Timeout Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus I2C set timeout operation allows the requestor to set the
timeout value to be used by the I2C adapter for non-responsive slave
devices.

Greybus I2C Set Timeout Request
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Table :num:`table-i2c-set-timeout-request` defines the Greybus I2C set
timeout request. The request contains a 16-bit value representing the
timeout to be used by an I2C adapter, expressed in milliseconds. If
the value supplied is zero, an I2C adapter-defined value shall be
used.

Greybus I2C Transfer Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus I2C transfer operation requests that the I2C adapter
perform an I2C transaction. The operation consists of a set of one or
more "I2C ops" to be performed by the I2C adapter. The transfer
operation request includes data for each I2C op involving a write
operation.  The data is concatenated (without padding) and is
sent immediately after the set of I2C op descriptors. The
transfer operation response includes data for each I2C op
involving a read operation, with all read data transferred
contiguously.

Greybus I2C Transfer Request
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Greybus I2C transfer request contains a message count, an array of
message descriptors, and a block of zero or more bytes of data to be
written.

Table :num:`table-i2c-op` defines the **Greybus I2C op**. An I2C op
describes a segment of an I2C transaction.
